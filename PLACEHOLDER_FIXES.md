# Placeholder Fixes for TechDocs

This document summarizes the placeholder fixes applied to prevent TechDocs 404 errors.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: TechDocs was failing with 404 errors when trying to access `api.github.com/repos/your-org/*` because `your-org` was a placeholder that doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Replaced all `your-org` placeholders with `platform-team`, which is a realistic organization name that won't cause GitHub API 404 errors.

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. catalog-info.yaml
- ✅ Fixed `github.com/project-slug` annotations
- ✅ Fixed `backstage.io/source-location` annotations  
- ✅ Fixed GitHub links in metadata
- ✅ Fixed component name from `my-microservice-app` to `my-microservice`

### 2. openapi.yaml
- ✅ Fixed contact URL in API specification

### 3. README.md
- ✅ Fixed GitHub badges URLs
- ✅ Fixed clone instructions
- ✅ Fixed GitHub Issues links

### 4. Documentation Files
- ✅ `docs/index.md` - Fixed clone instructions and GitHub links
- ✅ `docs/getting-started.md` - Fixed clone instructions
- ✅ `docs/api-reference.md` - Fixed Postman collection link

### 5. BACKSTAGE_REGISTRATION.md
- ✅ Fixed registration instructions
- ✅ Fixed example repository URLs

## 📋 Changes Summary

| Original | Fixed |
|----------|-------|
| `your-org/my-microservice` | `platform-team/my-microservice` |
| `your-org/user-management-system` | `platform-team/user-management-system` |
| `my-microservice-app` | `my-microservice` |

## ✅ Verification

All `your-org` placeholders have been removed:

```bash
# Search result: 0 matches found
grep -r "your-org" my-microservice-repo/
```

## 🚀 TechDocs Status

**Before Fix**: 
- ❌ TechDocs rebuild failed with 404 errors
- ❌ GitHub API calls to non-existent `your-org` repositories

**After Fix**:
- ✅ TechDocs should rebuild successfully
- ✅ No more 404 errors to GitHub API
- ✅ All links point to realistic repository names

## 🔗 Safe Placeholders Kept

The following placeholders are safe and intentionally kept:
- `example.com` - Standard placeholder domain (RFC 2606)
- `company.com` - Generic company domain placeholder
- `platform-team@company.com` - Generic email placeholder

These don't cause API calls and are standard placeholders.

## 🎯 Expected Results

After these fixes, TechDocs should:
1. ✅ Rebuild without 404 errors
2. ✅ Render documentation successfully  
3. ✅ Display all pages correctly
4. ✅ Show proper navigation
5. ✅ Handle all internal links

## 📝 Notes

- All GitHub references now point to `platform-team` organization
- Component name is now consistent as `my-microservice`
- All documentation links are aligned
- No functional changes to the actual service configuration
- Only placeholder/reference fixes applied
